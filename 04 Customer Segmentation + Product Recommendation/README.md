# K-Mean Clustering
Use "elbow method" to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) for K-means clustering. The idea behind this method is to run the K-means algorithm for a range of K values and calculate the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for each K. WCSS measures the variance within each cluster, and a lower WCSS indicates that the data points are closer to the centroids within their clusters, suggesting better clustering.
